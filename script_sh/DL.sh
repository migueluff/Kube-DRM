# Name: DL-1
# Case: CPU-heavy training loop (epochs with transient buffer growth)
# Explanation: Keeps a modest base footprint, runs CPU-saturating epochs, and
# allocates temporary buffers per epoch that are freed afterward. Stresses CPU
# co-scheduling (up to 32 threads) and tests that memory spikes are handled safely.
# Peak mem â‰ˆ 24 GiB; very high CPU can hurt neighbors.
