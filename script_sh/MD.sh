# Name: MD-1
# Case: Molecular Dynamics (steady working set + neighbor-list spikes)
# Explanation: Holds a steady footprint with rare short spikes (NL rebuilds / I/O),
# then releases back to baseline. Friendly to co-runners most of the time; spikes
# check that limits have headroom without constant resizing. Peak mem â‰ˆ 26 GiB.
